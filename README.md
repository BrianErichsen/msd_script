This program takes 1 or more algebraic expressions as an input and computes the final result of a given expression!
To run it; choose the following modes:
--help for instructions
--test to test all case bases
--interp to compute expression final result
--print to print a string version of given expression
--pretty_print for a prettier printed version of expression

How to run the program?
  Use the make file by typying make msdscript and run the program by ./msdscript [your argument]

  if in interp mode:
  input your expression and exit input by crt + d; then the program returns the value of given expression as input

  if in print mode:
  input your expression and exit input by crt + d; then the program returns a printed string version of given expression as input

  if in pretty_print mode:
    input your expression and exit input by crt + d; then the program returns a prettier printed string version of given expression as an  input
